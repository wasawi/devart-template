## About Us

Hi, We are Wendy Ann Mansilla and Jordi Puig. When we saw an announcement with DevArt with Google competition we immediately thought we should do something new! Yay!

We choose the project name Dreamsprawler because we want to visualize dreams that users share in a social network in a brain space. 

Jordi is currently completing his Ph. D and his thesis topic deals with brain interaction and visualization. 

Wendy Ann just finished her Ph.D and she is currently working on gamification, game-based learning, digital storytelling, and implicit experiences. 

We have worked together since 2009 on two successful art projects - Flick Flock and ChromaSpace which was exhibited at STRP Festival, Piksel, Campus Party and ACM Multimedia. We have also co-authored several papers published at Siggraph, Siggraph Asia, and ACM Multimedia. 

We are looking forward to complete out project proposal. We are doing our best to document our process. For suggestions, comments, or questions please contact us at wendy(dot)mansilla(at)ntnu(dot)no.
