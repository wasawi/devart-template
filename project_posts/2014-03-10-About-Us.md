## About Us

Hi, we are Wendy Ann Mansilla and Jordi Puig. When we saw an announcement with DevArt with Google competition we immediately thought we should do something new! Yay! We choose to propose a project named Dreamsprawler because we want to visualize dreams that users share in a social network to a brain space. 

Going back, Jordi is currently completing his Ph.D thesis which deals with brain interaction and visualization. 

Wendy Ann just finished her Ph.D and she is currently researching on gamification, game-based learning and implicit experiences, she`s also a lecturer on digital storytelling and immersive experiences. 

We have worked together since 2009 on two successful art projects - Flick Flock and ChromaSpace which was exhibited at STRP Festival, Piksel, Campus Party and ACM Multimedia. We have also co-authored several papers published at Siggraph, Siggraph Asia, and ACM Multimedia. 

We are looking forward to complete our project proposal. We are doing our best to document our process. For suggestions, comments, or questions please contact us at wendy(dot)mansilla(at)ntnu(dot)no.
