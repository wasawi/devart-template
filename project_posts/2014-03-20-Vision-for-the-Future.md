## Challenges

We are seeing some challenges in the development of the stable release of Dreamsprawler, for instance:

How to encourage users to upload and share data such as:

	* EEG, other biometric signals or sources.
	* videos and audio recordings
	* a bit of personal information to enrich the story generation


How to deal with privacy issues? 
	
	* probably using Google's security system.
	* What can be the implications of sharing private or intimate dreams?
	* We need to allow the users to create anonymous post (if they want).

How to combine different sorts of visualization seemlessly?
	
	* It would be ideal to see dreams by:
		world location
		by date of creation
		by age range of the dreamer
		by private circles, perhaps

**Users feedback regarding ideas for future development:**
	
	* Allow users to comment and share opinions to improve the application by
	  creating a post in their Google+ account under #Dreamsprawler_comment hashtag.
