## Current Challenges

How to encourage users to upload and share data from:

	* EEG, other dream signals or sources.
	* videos


How to deal with privacy issues? 
	
	* probably using Google's security system.
	* We need to allow the users to create anonymouse post (if they want).

How to combine different sorts of visualizations?
	
	* It would be ideal to see dreams by:
		world location
		by date of creation
		by age of user
		by private circles

**Users feedback regarding ideas for future development:**
	
	* Allow users to comment and share opinions to improve the application by
	  creating a post in their Google+ account under #Dreamsprawler_comment hashtag.
