## Google + Documentation and Retrieval Test with Python

There is no straightforward implementation of Google+ API available, we have to use Python Scripting. 
The installation procedure for the Google + API various from one machine to another depending on the package manager that you are using. But, here is our steps:



Step 1: We create a Google APIs Console project, authentication access with OAuth 2.0 which gives us the client ID, etc following this step:
https://developers.google.com/+/quickstart/python

Step 2: We installed Python using Homebrew:

```
 $ brew install python
```
Google + API requires Pip. Pip comes with the Homebrew installation but if you use anothe package manager:

Download pip at, http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html.
Create a file named get-pip.py with its contents and then run:
``
 $ sudo python get-pip.py

```
Step 3: Set up the Python quick-start app

The terminal commands below clones the Google+ application repository using git and decompresses it to your harddrive.
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/googleplus/gplus-quickstart-python.git
 $ wget https://github.com/googleplus/gplus-quickstart-python/archive/master.zip
 $ unzip gplus-quickstart-python-master.zip

```
