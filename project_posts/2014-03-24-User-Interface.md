Additional points:

* Top dreams are animated and displayed updating every 30 - 50 seconds.

* Ranking: the criteria to considered a top dream - parsed words are weighted for each dream report. A dream that contains the highest ranked content is prioritised for display, the time of update takes secondary precedence. So when are no or few dream updates, newly posted dreams are prioritised. 

* Brain access points: Each region of the brain has several dream spots/points (representing the voxel responses) corresponding to a particular word or object activating it. These points can be chosen using a mouse or a tracking probe device to animate relate dream. When a dream is identified to that area, it can also be identified to another spot in the brain, Thus, several blue light rays are reflected for each dream report pertaining to the nueral activation points triggered in the brain space.
