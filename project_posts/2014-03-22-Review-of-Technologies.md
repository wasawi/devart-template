#Recap of the Technologies Used

Today we have a very important step in our development. We are realizing that we should have done things in a different order... (yes, these may be challenging) but we think it can be our strength for the final outcome of our project.

We started our project pointing at several technologies (OF, googleAPI, Oauth, to name a few). These are not web technologies. We found out that we started on a more challenging approach. And we will explain why.

We wanted to have a high quality visuals and a very responsive application so we decided to do the client application in Openframeworks. The challenge with coding in C++ is that it can consume more time for us to provide a finished prototype to comply with the DevArt`s deadline. However, we are confident that can use the currently developed application as a reliable and stable interactive installation at the Barbican Centre, because it is capable of running in a high-end set-up described [here](2014-03-19-Installation-Insights.md)

In our final prototype we will show most of our concepts but we feel we could have developed more. We thought that if we started with the web technology, we could have done a more comprehensive prototype using WebGL, [X toolkit](https://github.com/xtk/X), socket.IO, and others. This is because web applications are mostly faster to develop.

We would like to think that we haven't lost time. But instead we have worked on the side that`s more challenging to reach a "finished" prototype that can show conceptual functionality. We still feel that  C++ would the best platform to use in the final physical installation. But at the same time a cloud-based set-up is ideal to reach more audience and we still would like to aim on that in the future.

Therefore we envision a high-end application for the installation using Openframeworks and a web application for the Internet users written in Javascript using WebGL, [X toolkit](https://github.com/xtk/X), socket.IO, and others.

We will keep giving our best until the deadline.
