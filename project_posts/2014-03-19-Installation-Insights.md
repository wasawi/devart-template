## Physical Installation Insights

Dreamsprawler installation will use an Optical See-Through display to overlay the virtual information into a phantom head. The user will be able to navigate the brain using a tracked probe device in the same fashion as neurosurgeons use it in pre-operative planning.

While navigating the brain, the user will find active areas in specific parts of the neural system that corresponds to the real-time dream stories shared at Google+.

Pointing a specific region in the brain with the probe device will trigger a search within Google+ repository for related dream object that activated the selected area.
