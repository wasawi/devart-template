## Physical Installation Insights

Dreamsprawler`s physical installation will use an optical see-through display to overlay the virtual information into a phantom head. The user will be able to navigate the brain using a tracked probe device in the same fashion as neurosurgeons use it in pre-operative planning.

While navigating the brain, the user will find active areas in specific parts of the neural system that corresponds to the real-time dream stories shared at Google+.

Pointing a specific region in the brain with the probe device will trigger a search within Google+ repository for coherent dream stories activating the selected area.

**Hardware Technology**

Dreamsprawler will use the hardware technology of a previously deployed installation called A-me. A-me is an augmented reality installation that allows a visitor to experience user recorded 3D audio information mapped on a brain, as shown below:

In other installations we used a tracking systems to allow users using probe to explore the brain.  That setup looks impressive but it has also several drawbacks:

• It is very difficult to prevent tracking misalignment by occlusion. 

• It takes a huge effort to set it up. The cameras have to be calibrated every time they are moved and that requires training.

• The cost of the equipment is very high.

Therefore we would like to try other technologies, which are more interesting for this use case. Haptic devices would allow us to use force feedback so that the user can have also a feeling when navigating the brain. Searching through information would then become more physical.

Here are some suggestions:
• SensAble Phantom Omni

• SensAble Phantom Desktop

The rest of the equipment could be the following:

• 120Hz monitor for shutter glasses

• Nvidia 3dVision Pro kit

• Nvidia quadro 4000

• Desktop computer
• Structure
• Half silvered mirror



**Installation Space**

Our installation will require approximately 2 square meter of gallery space, which can fit perfectly Barbican Centre`s requirement, see diagram below:
