## Physical Installation Insights

Dreamsprawler`s physical installation will use an optical see-through display to overlay the virtual information into a phantom head. The user will be able to navigate the brain using a tracked probe device in the same fashion as neurosurgeons use it in pre-operative planning.

While navigating the brain, the user will find active areas in specific parts of the neural system that corresponds to the real-time dream stories shared at Google+.

Pointing a specific region in the brain with the probe device will trigger a search within Google+ repository for coherent dream stories activating the selected area.

**Hardware Technology**

Dreamsprawler will use the hardware technology of a previously deployed installation called A-me. A-me is an augmented reality installation that allows a visitor to experience user recorded 3D audio information mapped on a brain, as shown below:
