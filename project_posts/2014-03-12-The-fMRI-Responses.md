## The fMRI BOLD responses data

Our training data containing the fMRI BOLD responses to natural imagery was from the Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCN.org) or Gallant.org. Unfortunately, only people with University affiliation are able to request data from them (But if your intentions are noble, send an email). Gallant Labs training data contains 1,750 responses (one per training image) in each of ~25,000 voxels and the validation data is 120 responses in each of ~25,000 voxels. If you don`t have a Matlab software you can access the data using python (you'll need the pyTables library and numpy).

Below is a sketch studying how we can use the data from UC Berkeley in Dreamsprawler:
