## Current challenges:

How to encourage users to upload and share data from:

	• EEG or other sources.
	videos


How to deal with privacy issues? 
	
	• probably using Google's systems.
	• We need to let the user's anonimize their posts (if they want).

How to combine different sorts of visualizations?
	
	•It wold be cool to see dreams by:
		world location
		by date of creation
		by age of user
		by private circles

## Ideas for future development:
	
	• Let users comment and share oppinions through the application will post on their Google+ account under #Dreamsprawler
