#Project Work-Flow and Work-in-Progress

2 days to go and we are still trying and pushing hard to complete a simple prototype. The project is challenging and it involves so many things, but we are trying to implement simple small prototypes that can be integrated better later on. To complete and this type of project we need few more time of dedicated work, perhaps a month more. But for now, we are pushing.
