We have done a big amount of work these days. Coding trying and a lot of research on develpment platforms. There could have been a lot of possibilities for project coding improvement but time is up. 

In general, we have implemented the installation prototype of the project. We want to create a web interface as well but we realized that coding two platforms in a month is a bit too ambitious. The standalone version that we developed at the moment is good enough but we want more things to improve:

1. We want to handle the huge file datasets to visualize semantic mappings of the voxel responses when dreaming but at the moment, we have to take some thousand dataset as compared to hundred thousand dataset. We have found a solution to handle huge datasets but we need a bit more time to implement that.

2. Gallant Lab`s mapping to the brain space also needs refinement especially in terms of visualization.

3. We have to populate more dreams at Google+ to test the application and its also a must to improve the storytelling generation.

4. Testing in a real user scenario or installations space.

5. Improve integration of apps and test stability.


It has been a very productive to use github and DevArt website as a tool to actually help us work together remotely. Each of us had tasks and documented our respective processes in this proposal.  Our process in interaction design and initial coding prototype that we blogged here also helped us learn more about each other`s progresses and sometimes helped us recreate or recheck tasks that the other has already done before.

We hope to keep developing this project no mater the result of the contest. We think that we found an interesting area of research and we would like to discuss it and open it to explore other points of view.

With that said, we already got our reward by looking at the work done :)
