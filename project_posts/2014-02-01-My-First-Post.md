### What are dreams and reality machine?

Sleep is inevitable and is incredibly important because evolution hasn't gotten around to replacing or fixing it. Virtually every animal needs some form of sleep. In most animals, sleeping is frequently associated with dreaming. 

According to Sigmund Freud dreams were filled with latent content and in their bizarre narrative representation lies the hidden psychological meaning that is deeply rooted with one`s instinctual motives and desires.

In Neuroscience, dreams are not related to hidden urges but to the firing of neurons and oscillation of chemicals in the brain that happens mostly during the "rapid eye movement" (REM) or even on other stages of sleep. The basic idea is that the brain has a neuronal system that generates a dream/virtual reality of the information stored in waking world. A dream is merely a virtual world that appears to be generated internally without benefit of sensory input.

The concept of dream reality machine in general is no longer science fiction and we are just waiting for time before prefection of technology. What we have today are devices that create the experience of reality by stimulation of the senses externally, but eventually the brain could be stimulated directly to produce similar or more powerful results. 


### Do dreams have a pattern?

Some psychologist concludes that dreams have patterns and is predictable. Based on thousands of data, recent dream content studies have established regularities in dream content. For instance, Calvin Hall, by the time he died in 1985, he had synopses of more than fifty thousand dreams from people of all age groups and nationalities. Randall in his book, "Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep" accounts that:

"Dream plots were consistent enough that, just by knowing the cast of characters in a dream, Hall could forecast what would happen with surprising accuracy. A dream featuring a man whom the dreamer doesn´t know in real life, for instance, almost always entails a plot in which the stranger is aggressive. Adults tend to dream of other people they know, while kids usually dream of animals. About three out of every four characters in a man´s dream will be other men, while women tend to encounter an equal number of males and females. Most dreams take place in the dreamers homes or offices and, if they have to go somewhere, they drive cars or walk there. And not surprisingly, college students dream about sex more often than middle-aged adults" and so on. Such regularities are broadly consistent with the dream as Virtual Reality machine.

The fact that dreams have patterns helped us realised that it is possible for us to reconstruct a story out of people`s dream report. 

Here is our research sketch of the patterns of sleep and its potential salient activation in the brain:

### Why do I need to track my sleep and record my dreams?

It is amazing to visualize our dreams, and see the coherent dreams of others. To be able to see which parts of our brains were activated while we are unconsciously imagining something is wonderful and novel. This could potentially inspire dream studies and artists to understand dreaming and the process of creativity and imagination. Your shared data can potentially help reconstruct missing pieces of your dream which we normally forget as soon as we wake up. Perhaps, you can simply expand the awareness of yourself by recording and visualizing your dreams overtime. Or you can share your reconstructed visual dream story through the social media.

### What can you share in our dream repository or at Google+?

You can dictate your dreams, write the story of your dream, write your feelings, and share it to our repository. You can create a username in our repository, it can all be anonymous. You can share your dreams at Google+.The whole suggested meta-data or content structure to help us visualise your dreams will be posted to you soon.


For the second phase of the our project, you can share us your EEG readings or hook your actigraph recordings to our web repository


### Where can I see my dream story and the visual dreams of others?

We want to create a web-based repository where you can share your dream story through your mobile or computer as soon as you wake up. In our repository, you will see an ecosystem of dreamers mapped in a single brain creating a coherent dream story and brain activations. We also want to map your personal story overtime. It`s a live performance by hundreds of dreams interpreted from the database and social media and hopefully hundreds more dreams from you and other dream sharers.

### What are future applications of Dreamsprawler?

We are investigating as well on the usage of the brain wave (EEG) activity technology and how the data can be incorporated with Dreamsprawler. In principle, it should be possible to decode the visual content of mental processes like dreams and imagination. However, we still have to wait for the technology to be able to accurately capture good measurements of brain activity in comfort of our homes. At the moment, there is no complete computational model of the brain that processes a dreaming visual perception directly. But this is interesting because we believe our visualisation initiative will help people realise what dreams are really be made of.
