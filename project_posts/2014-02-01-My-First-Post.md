###Study of how to use the fMRI BOLD responses data from UC Berkeley

Our training data containing the fMRI BOLD responses to natural imagery was from the Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCN.org) or Gallant.org. Unfornately only people with University affiliation are able to request data from them (But if your intentions are noble, they are very nice people, unfortunately people from Gallant.org will likely to reply long, follow-up and wait). We converted the data from a Matlab file to CSV. The training data contains 1,750 responses (one per training image) in each of ~25,000 voxels and the validation data is 120 responses in each of ~25,000 voxels.

Below is a sketch studying how we can use the data from UC Berkeley in Dreamsprawler:
