* We would also like to run statistics on the dreams of the people. For example, how many times the word "cat" has been mentioned and what this word usually related to in a dream. And also using heat maps to display where the word or object is located in the brain space (using the data correlations with Gallantâ€™s dataset).

* We would also like to explore digital storytelling by generating stories of the people`s world dream. Wendy has developed an installation called Candy that generates the most popular food cravings of people at a given time. Candy take twits of users to create a narrative food palette:
