#####"The Internet and dreams are the same, they are areas where the mind escapes...Its potential is wonderful, the ability to see a friend`s dream as if its your own inspirational experience, both of you seeing the same dream."
(from the movie "Paprika" by Satoshi Kon)


## Description

Imagine yourself connected with thousands of dreamers each night. A social network of dreamers where people explore what other people are dreaming in time and space. 

If our brain is a living semantic environment, how will it perform when its being fed by shared dream compositions? What do our dreams have in common? What do the world dreamers share in common? How will it sound like? What kind of feeling will it elicit?

Together with the recent brain activity semantic mappings of natural imagery from UC Berkeley, the dreamers dream report, and the dream narratives crowdsourced from Google+, Google search, and the Internet, we can capture the real-time performance of the dreamer`s moving imagery and soundscape in a precise medical 3D brain scan. The result is an audio-visual web-based installation that reconstructs the story of a dream by visualising the neurons fired on the brain based on the context of the dream with its accompanied synthesized sounds and graphically recreating the dream story scenario. 


### Inspirations

One of our motivation is to create an awareness of the technological singularity. Advances in the brain computing is fast approaching than we think it is. We are just waiting for technology to mature. Efforts in science, for instance to decode the mind by tapping into the brain while we are conscious or even unconcious or the recent discovery of the real wiring structure of neurons in the brain, is already developing rapidly. Science and technology is pushing the boundaries, leaving ordinary people like us, wondering and unprepared. We have to be able to hear and experience the story of how technology and science interact. By sharing pragments of your dream story to Dreamsprawler we`ll be able to discover our relationship with our unconcious self and the environment we are living in. 

Whenever we are dreaming in our sleep, we are actually undergoing a process of "repair". We are repairing not just our body but also preparing ourselves for the next day or even our future. We experience nightmares because our mind needs to learn and cope up with the daily pressure and dangers in life. Dreams are essential to our well-being. Dreams can also give us a hint of the areas in life that we need to learn and cope up.
