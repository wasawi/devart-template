# Dreamsprawler


#####"The Internet and dreams are the same, they are areas where the mind escapes...Its potential is wonderful, the ability to see a friend`s dream as if its your own inspirational experience, both of you seeing the same dream."
(from the movie "Paprika" by Satoshi Kon)

## Description


If our brain is a living semantic environment, how will it perform when its being fed by shared dream compositions? What do our dreams have in common? What do the world dreamers share in common? How will it sound like? What kind of feeling will it elicit?

Starting from the dream story you shared at Google+ or our web repository, our code will break down the objects and events in your dreams. Your dreams will bring life to Dreamsprawler, a single brain visualising one coherent dream story.

Based on the brain activity semantic mappings of natural imagery from UC Berkeley, your dream report, and the dream narratives crowdsourced from Google+, and the Internet, Dreamsprawler will capture the world dream story and soundscape in a precise medical 3D brain scan. The result is a coherent vizualization of the lights and sounds of the neurons fired on the brain while dreaming and graphically recreating the dream story scenario. 



### Inspirations

One of the motivation of Dreamsprawler is to create an awareness of the technological singularity. Advances in the brain computing is fast approaching than we think it is. We are just waiting for technology to mature. Efforts in science, for instance to decode the mind by tapping into the brain while we are conscious or even unconcious or the recent discovery of the real wiring structure of neurons in the brain, is already developing rapidly. Science and technology is pushing the boundaries, leaving ordinary people like us, wondering and unprepared. We have to be able to hear and experience the story of how technology and science interact. By sharing pragments of your dream story to Dreamsprawler we`ll be able to discover our relationship with our unconcious self and the environment we are living in. 

Whenever we are dreaming in our sleep, we are actually undergoing a process of "repair". We are repairing not just our body but also preparing ourselves for the next day or even our future. We experience nightmares because our mind needs to learn and cope up with the daily pressure and dangers in life. Dreams are essential to our well-being. Dreams can also give us a hint of the areas in life that we need to learn and cope up.
