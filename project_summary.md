# Dreamsprawler


#####"The Internet and dreams are the same, they are areas where the mind escapes...Its potential is wonderful, the ability to see a friend`s dream as if its your own inspirational experience, both of you seeing the same dream."
(from the movie "Paprika" by Satoshi Kon)

## Description


Dreamsprawler aims to map people's dreams on a brain. It could be rephrased as the "global map of people's dreams".
Users of the application will be able to describe their dreams using text, images, voices, or videos. All this data will be uploaded to Google+ under #Dreamsprawler hashtag. Our application will use this data to allow users to revisit other people's dreams.

To do so, the user will be able to navigate a brain, and that's where all the dreams will be placed. Searching for keywords will display their dream locations in the brain space. Dreamsprawler will also rank the world dream and display top dream texts and its corresponding imagery to form a coherent dream story. The mapping between dream context and brain neural responses will be done by using Gallant Lab`s data correlations (www.gallantlab.org).

### Inspirations

If our brain is a living semantic environment, how will it perform when its being fed by shared dream compositions? What do our dreams have in common? What do the world dreamers share in common? How will it sound like? What kind of feeling will it elicit?

Starting from the dream story you shared at Google+, our code will break down the objects and events in your dreams. Your dreams will bring life to Dreamsprawler, a single brain visualising one coherent dream story.

Based on the scientific brain activity semantic mappings of natural imagery from UC Berkeley, your dream report crowdsourced from Google+, and the Internet, Dreamsprawler will capture the world dream story and soundscape in a precise 3D brain scan. The result is a coherent dreamscape of the neurons fired on the brain and the graphical reconstruction of the world dream story scenario. 

One of the motivation of Dreamsprawler is to create an awareness of the technological singularity. Advances in the brain computing is fast approaching than we think it is. We are just waiting for technology to mature. Efforts in science, for instance to decode the mind by tapping into the brain while we are conscious or even unconcious or the recent discovery of the real wiring structure of neurons in the brain, is already developing rapidly. Science and technology is pushing the boundaries, leaving ordinary people like us, wondering and unprepared. We have to be able to hear and experience the story of how technology and science interact. By sharing pragments of your dream story to Dreamsprawler we`ll be able to discover our relationship with our unconcious self and the environment we are living in. 

Whenever we are dreaming in our sleep, we are actually undergoing a process of "repair". We are repairing not just our body but also preparing ourselves for the next day or even our future. We experience nightmares because our mind needs to learn and cope up with the daily pressure and dangers in life. Dreams are essential to our well-being. Dreams can also give us a hint of the areas in life that we need to learn and cope up.

## Example Code

Current coding progress:

We are currently focusing in two developments:
	The client application to handle all visualization.
	The ofxGallant addon to map parsed words to the brain space.
