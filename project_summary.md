#####"The Internet and dreams are the same, they are areas where the mind escapes...Its potential is wonderful, the ability to see a friend`s dream as if its your own inspirational experience, both of you seeing the same dream."
(from the movie "Paprika" by Satoshi Kon)


## Description

Imagine yourself connected with thousands of dreamers each night. A social network of dreamers where people explore what other people are dreaming in time and space. 

If our brain is a living semantic environment, how will it perform when its being fed by shared dream compositions? What do our dreams have in common? What do the world dreamers share in common? How will it sound like? What kind of feeling will it elicit?

Together with the recent brain activity semantic mappings of natural imagery from UC Berkeley, the dreamers dream report, and the dream narratives crowdsourced from Google+, Google search, and the Internet, we can capture the real-time performance of the dreamer`s moving imagery and soundscape in a precise medical 3D brain scan. The result is an audio-visual web-based installation that reconstructs the story of the person´s dream by visualising the neurons fired on the brain based on the context of the dream with its accompanied synthesized sounds and graphically recreating the dream story scenario. 


### Inspirations

One of our motivation is to create an awareness of the technological singularity. Advances in the brain computing is fast approaching than we think it is. We are just waiting for technology to mature. Efforts in science, for instance to decode the mind by tapping into the brain while we are conscious or even unconcious or the recent discovery of the real wiring structure of neurons in the brain, is already developing rapidly. Science and technology is pushing the boundaries, leaving ordinary people like us, wondering and unprepared. We have to be able to hear and experience the story of how technology and science interact. By sharing pragments of your dream story to Dreamsprawler we`ll be able to discover our relationship with our unconcious self and the environment we are living in. 

Whenever we are dreaming in our sleep, we are actually undergoing a process of "repair". We are repairing not just our body but also preparing ourselves for the next day or even our future. We experience nightmares because our mind needs to learn and cope up with the daily pressure and dangers in life. Dreams are essential to our well-being. Dreams can also give us a hint of the areas in life that we need to learn and cope up. 


### What are dreams and reality machine?

Sleep is inevitable and is incredibly important because evolution hasn't gotten around to replacing or fixing it. Virtually every animal needs some form of sleep. In most animals, sleeping is frequently associated with dreaming. 

According to Sigmund Freud dreams were filled with latent content and in their bizarre narrative representation lies the hidden psychological meaning that is deeply rooted with one`s instinctual motives and desires.

In Neuroscience, dreams are not related to hidden urges but to the firing of neurons and oscillation of chemicals in the brain that happens mostly during the "rapid eye movement" (REM) or even on other stages of sleep. The basic idea is that the brain has a neuronal system that generates a dream/virtual reality of the information stored in waking world. A dream is merely a virtual world that appears to be generated internally without benefit of sensory input.

The concept of dream reality machine in general is no longer science fiction and we are just waiting for time before prefection of technology. What we have today are devices that create the experience of reality by stimulation of the senses externally, but eventually the brain could be stimulated directly to produce similar or more powerful results. 


### Do dreams have a pattern?

Some psychologist concludes that dreams have patterns and is predictable. Based on thousands of data, recent dream content studies have established regularities in dream content. For instance, Calvin Hall, by the time he died in 1985, he had synopses of more than fifty thousand dreams from people of all age groups and nationalities. Randall in his book, "Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep" accounts that:

"Dream plots were consistent enough that, just by knowing the cast of characters in a dream, Hall could forecast what would happen with surprising accuracy. A dream featuring a man whom the dreamer doesn’t know in real life, for instance, almost always entails a plot in which the stranger is aggressive. Adults tend to dream of other people they know, while kids usually dream of animals. About three out of every four characters in a man’s dream will be other men, while women tend to encounter an equal number of males and females. Most dreams take place in the dreamers’ homes or offices and, if they have to go somewhere, they drive cars or walk there. And not surprisingly, college students dream about sex more often than middle-aged adults…" and so on. Such regularities are broadly consistent with the dream as Virtual Reality machine.

The fact that dreams have patterns helped us realised that it is possible for us to reconstruct a story out of people`s dream report. 


Here is our research sketch of the patterns of sleep and its potential salient activation in the brain:

### Why do I need to track my sleep and record my dreams?

It is amazing to visualize our dreams, and see the coherent dreams of others. To be able to see which parts of our brains were activated while we are unconsciously imagining something is wonderful and novel. This could potentially inspire dream studies and artists to understand dreaming and the process of creativity and imagination. Your shared data can potentially help reconstruct missing pieces of your dream which we normally forget as soon as we wake up. Perhaps, you can simply expand the awareness of yourself by recording and visualizing your dreams overtime. Or you can share your reconstructed visual dream story through the social media.


### What can you share in our dream repository or at Google+?

You can dictate your dreams, write the story of your dream, write your feelings, and share it to our repository. You can create a username in our repository, it can all be anonymous. You can share your dreams at Google+.The whole suggested meta-data or content structure to help us visualise your dreams will be posted to you soon.


For the second phase of the our project, you can share us your EEG readings or hook your actigraph recordings to our web repository


### Where can I see my dream story and the visual dreams of others?

We want to create a web-based repository where you can share your dream story through your mobile or computer as soon as you wake up. In our repository, you will see an ecosystem of dreamers mapped in a single brain creating a coherent dream story and brain activations. We also want to map your personal story overtime. It`s a live performance by hundreds of dreams interpreted from the database and social media and hopefully hundreds more dreams from you and other dream sharers.

### How does the dream composition / performance look and sound like?

Your shared dream is processed by our developed application and your dreams will activate the brain neurons. Each firing or activation of the neurons has corresponding synthesized sounds together with the brain`s visual consciousness activation. The performance, like the brain are interconnected, not by accident or randomness but by series of rules, patterns, interacting with each other.

### What are future applications of Dreamsprawler?

We are investigating as well on the usage of the brain wave (EEG) activity technology and how the data can be incorporated with Dreamsprawler. In principle, it should be possible to decode the visual content of mental processes like dreams and imagination. However, we still have to wait for the technology to be able to accurately capture good measurements of brain activity in comfort of our homes. At the moment, there is no complete computational model of the brain that processes a dreaming visual perception directly. But this is interesting because we believe our visualisation initiative will help people realise what dreams are really be made of.
